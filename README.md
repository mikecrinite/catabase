Initial repo I made for a web programming project that would have been a website for users to post pictures of their pets and search an extensive database of people's pet pictures.

Another group member beat me to making a git project though so this is just chillin here for whenever I wanna learn something about web programming

UPDATE (May 2017):
  I ended up doing most of the work for that group project, but due to time constraints it didn't turn out quite as well as I would have 
  liked. So I'm going to go ahead and continue working on this one whenever I have time so that it turns out a little better than the 
  other one.
